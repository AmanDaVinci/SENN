TODO: Diagram
The project is organized as follows:
1. **models**: classes defining model architecture
2. **configs**: experiment configurations
3. **trainers**: scripts for training
4. **datasets**: scripts for data loading
5. **utils**: utility functions
6. **doc**: API documentation
7. **notebooks**: development notebooks showing some of the APIs
8. **results**: recorded results of experiments
9. **results/checkpoints**: saved model weights
10. *report.ipynb*: notebook reporting final results
