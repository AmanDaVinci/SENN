TODO: Diagram
The project is organized as follows:
1. **models**: classes defining model architecture
2. **configs**: experiment configurations
3. **trainers**: scripts for training
4. **datasets**: scripts for data loading
5. **results**: recorded results of experiments
6. **checkpoints**: saved model weights
7. *report.ipynb*: notebook reporting final results
