# Self-Explaining Neural Networks: A review with extensions

This repository contains the code for reproducing the paper ``Towards Robust Interpretability with Self-Explaining Neural Networks''[1] and extending it. The authors propose a framework called SENN (Self-Explaining Neural Network) which is transparent by design. We study the reproducibilty and validity of the proposed framework. Several weaknesses of the approach are identified. Most notably, we find that the model rarely generates good explanations, and that performance is compromised more than reported by the authors when enforcing explanations to be stable.  We put forward improvements to the framework that address these weaknesses in a principled way, and show them to enhance the interpretability of generated explanations.

## How to run?

1. Clone and activate our conda environment
```
 git clone https://github.com/AmanDaVinci/SENN
 cd senn
 conda env create -f "environment.yml
 conda activate senn
```

2. To reproduce our results using trained models, run the [Report Notebook](report.ipynb).  

3. To train a model using one of our experiment parameters:
```
  python main.py --config "configs/compas_lambda1e-4_seed555.json"
```

4. To train a new model or perform a new experiment:
```
 python main.py --config "./config.json"
```

Where *config.json* is prepared according to the template below:

```

}
```
Note: It is also possible to specify the architectures of the parameterizer and conceptizer classes using *config* parameters. However, to keep it neat, these are not shown here. For more information, please refer to the docstrings of the specific classes and the parameters they can take.
